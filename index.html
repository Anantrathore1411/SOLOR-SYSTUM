<p class="me"><b>The solar system is a collection of planets, moons, asteroids, comets, dust and gas that orbit our local star, the sun.<br> It includes the rocky inner planets Mercury,
     Venus, Earth and Mars; the gas giants Jupiter and Saturn; and the ice giants Uranus and Neptune.<br>

    Between Mars and Jupiter is a collection of asteroids known as the asteroid belt,<br> while beyond Neptune is where small icy bodies, like Pluto and comets, live.</b></p>
     <h1 class="solor">How old is our solar system?</h1>

     <p class="me">About 4.6 billion years ago, a giant cloud of dust and gas known as the solar nebula collapsed in on itself and began to form what would eventually become the solar system's sun and planets.<br> Meteorites, or pieces of space rock that have fallen to Earth, have helped scientists figure out the age of the solar system. <br>Some of these small pieces have broken off of moons or planets and can yield interesting scientific information about the chemistry and history of their home body.<br> Others have been traveling around the solar system since its beginning, before the planets even existed. The Allende meteorite, which fell to Earth in 1969 and scattered over Mexico,
  <br>       is the oldest known meteorite, at 4.55 billion years old. </p>

    <h1 class="solor">How did our solar system form?   </h1> 
    <p class="me">Scientists think the solar system formed when a nearby exploding star, called a supernova,<br> triggered the collapse of the solar nebula. According to this theory, the <br>explosion sent shock waves through space, and those shock waves pushed parts of the nebula closer together, leading to collapse.,<br> The supernova may have even seeded material into the nebula, Live Science previously reported. For instance, <br>scientists have found that aluminum-26, an element formed only in the hearts of stars, <br>most likely originated from a series of nearby supernovas, Live Science sister site Space.com reported.<BR>
